## üí° About
Wissen is a  LLM-powered chatbot that can handle conversations across multiple documents.
This app is built with
- Langchain
- Google Palm
- Streamlit

**Wissen has two ways to chat with you:**

1. `Document Q&A Mode:`
- Uses Google's powerful Palm Base model for answering your questions.
- Activated when you upload documents to Wissen.
- In this mode, Wissen can only answer questions about the documents you've uploaded.

2. `Normal Conversation Mode:`
- This is the default mode when you start Wissen.
- Uses Google's Palm Chat model for open-ended conversation.
- Ask anything you want in this mode.
- Wissen also switches to this mode when you clear all uploaded documents.

**Switching between modes is automatic:**
- Uploading documents puts Wissen in Document Q&A mode.
- Clearing all documents brings Wissen back to Normal Conversation mode.
